        * Each crime is marked with a bitmap marker indicating the type of crime
                * gun for shooting
                * $ for robbery
                * etc
        * have to decide how far back to display crimes
            * crimes within past month
            * crimes within past 5 years
        * use csv file to show crime for each city
            * potentially use Python to read csv data
        * Use dictionary to pair crime codes and bitmap icons
            * check a crime code from the csv with the dictionary, and use corresponding icon for the map
    * Settings
        * Night mode
        * Font size
        * Option to save a certain city so that the map opens by itself the next time you open the app
